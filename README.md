## VimÂ³

Most people use vim in two stupid dimensions. But not me. I use it in three:

</p>

To run it, [install Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html), and from this repo do:

```
nimble run vim3
```

Once you're ready to start using it as your main editor, do:

```
nimble install paravim
nimble install
```

As long as `~/.nimble/bin` is on your PATH, you will now be able to open files like this:

```
vim3 path/to/myfile.txt
```

## Q & A

### How do i acquire your power?

It's not that hard

### How do i stop the cube from spinning

no

### I don't even have vim installed, how is this possible?

It's using [paravim](https://github.com/paranim/paravim) which has a real copy of vim built in

### Which OS does it work on?

All of them pretty much

### Why can't i run it on linux?

Could be you need opengl libraries, try `sudo apt install xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`

You might also need to do `sudo apt install libtinfo5`

### I use arch btw

Try this: `sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.6 /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5`

### The big question here: Why

You may not share our intellect
Which might explain your disrespect
For all the natural wonders that grow around you

So long, so long and thanks for all the fish
